1. Find and Kill all apt-get or apt Processes

	$ ps -A | grep apt

	$ sudo kill -9 processnumber
		OR
	$ sudo kill -SIGKILL processnumber

Still it says the same!!!

2. Delete the lock Files

	$ sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock

Afterwards force package(s) to reconfigure like so:

	$ sudo dpkg --configure -a


Aaahhhh????, still it doesn't work. 

Alternatively, delete the lock files in the /var/lib/apt/lists/ and cache directory as below:

	$ sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
	$ sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock


Do the following anyway
---------------------------------
Next, update your packages sources list as follows:

	$ sudo apt update
		OR
	$ sudo apt-get update
