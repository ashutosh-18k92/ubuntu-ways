The chmod command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory.

$ sudo chmod <permission_code> <file|folder>

rwx rwx rwx = 111 111 111
rw- rw- rw- = 110 110 110
rwx --- --- = 111 000 000

and so on...

rwx = 111 in binary = 7
rw- = 110 in binary = 6
r-x = 101 in binary = 5
r-- = 100 in binary = 4

755 : (rwxr-xr-x) The file's owner may read, write, and execute the file. All others may read and execute the file. This setting is 		common for programs that are used by all users.

700 : (rwx------) The file's owner may read, write, and execute the file. Nobody else has any rights. This setting is useful for programs that only the owner may use and must be kept private from others.

666 : (rw-rw-rw-) All users may read and write the file.

644 : (rw-r--r--) The owner may read and write a file, while all others may only read the file. A common setting for data files that 		everybody may read, but only the owner may change.

600 : (rw-------) The owner may read and write a file. All others have no rights. A common setting for data files that the owner 	wants to keep private.
